# Neuromancer.vim

Neuromancer is a vim colorscheme compatible with gVim and terminal vim (versions
higher than 7.4). It's inspired by the "High Tech, Low Life" philosophy.

Right now it's under active development and will frequently change as I add new
colors.

I intend to fully support the following languages:

- [x] Python
- [x] Markdown

- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Sass
- [ ] Golang
- [ ] SQL
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] Jinja2 (the templating engine)
- [ ] Yaml
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] Bash

It's going to be a lot of work, but also a lot of fun.

Feel free to leave any feedback, notes or comments. I'm
